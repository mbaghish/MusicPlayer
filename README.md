## Task
Create a program that manages pieces of music.
Additional information such as title, artist, genre, etc. should be kept for each piece of music.
The user should be able to search for certain pieces of music according to different criteria.
Furthermore, playlists should be able to be created automatically according to various criteria:
e.g. all pieces of music of a performer or a group or all pieces of music of a genre etc.
The administration should take place via a suitable graphical user interface (GUI).
